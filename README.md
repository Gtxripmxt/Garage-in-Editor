# Garage In Editor

This mod does nothing but adds an extra entry rope button in *EditLevelLayer* (the layer menu where you edit&play&publish your level),
And the rope does wholly the same thing with the one in *LevelInfoLayer* (entrance of a saved level).

### Special Thanks
Huge Thanks to @TheSillyDoggo for helping with the callback function!
